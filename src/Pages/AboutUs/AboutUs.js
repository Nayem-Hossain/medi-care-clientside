                <Accordion.Body>
                  Decay is caused by bacteria that collect on teeth and feed on
                  the carbohydrates in our diet. The bacteria produce acid that
                  wears away at the enamel on our teeth. If decay is left
                  untreated, it can cause pain, infection and even tooth loss.
                  Protect your teeth against decay by brushing at least twice a
                  day, flossing daily, visiting your dentist regularly.

            <p className="py-4 text-secondary fw-light">
              It is indeed a great pleasure for me to introduce our brand new
              state of the art technology hospital in the region of Chittagong.
              Nowadays, if anyone needs good treatment, they need to look
              forward to Dhaka or Abroad. Because good and well facilitated
              hospitals are not available in the port city of Chittagong. <br />
              The pursuit of excellence in all these areas is the result of our
              willingness, commitment, dedication and strong moral determination
              to provide the highest quality of care.
